- Aim to decide to on clear responsibilities today, reconvene on Sunday
- Testing:
    - Mocha vs Jest
        - Decision: Jest
        - Mocha requires more dependencies for same function
        - Jest is simpler, has mocking built in
    - Look if thereâ€™s a way to combine testing with enzyme + jest in circle ci
    - Snapshot testing can be finicky - potential range for testing frontend
- Milestones

    - Flesh out 3rd and 4th milestones

        - Potential additions: integration testing, user testing
