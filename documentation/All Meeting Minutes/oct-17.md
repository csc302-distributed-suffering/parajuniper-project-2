# Minutes - October 17th, 2021

### Progress Update
- discussed UI 
    - search bar for getting list of patients based on parameters (just use name for now, add more for next milestones)
    - display patients in grid? 
        - create react cards
    - felicia/eric create Figma mockup and implementation
- backend
    - create routes for listing patients and then getting all information
    - unit tests?
        - at least should have stubs, can scope them out further if need be
    
### Milestone Updates
- circleci causing trouble - move it to milestone 3 or scrap entirely
    - not providing any benefit - small team of 4 people doesnt require CI tools that much
- showing all patient information - push to milestone 3
    - suffices to just query patients and show that end to end communication is occurring
- ui
    - just needs to show searched patients, can show specific patients if have extra time

### Decisions Made
- some milestone changes
- fleshed out plan and reinforced division of tasks
- (NB [Nov 4th]: SEE milestone2.md FOR FULL LIST OF DECISIONS MADE + JUSTIFICATION)
