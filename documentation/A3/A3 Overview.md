# A3 Overview


## Project Features







## Features and Tasks that were Missed:

### API Documentation
For our milestone 3 (which is effectively A3 when combined with milestone 4) we were aiming to have documentation of our internal API. However, due to unforeseen issues with some key features (FHIR server now working as expected and UI styling working differently for different browsers) we voted on not delivering this for our final submission.

### Defects backlog never implemented
We were planning on having a defects backlog to keep track of issues that need to be fixed on Github. We decided to not implement this to save time as we were all aware of issues with our specific areas (frontend and backend) and therefore trusted each other to fix them as necessary. Most of our communication was done through a Discord chat which provided a better alternative to asynchronous communication on Github. Therefore, it was more efficient for us to assign work through Discord.

### Code coverage stayed at 78%
Code coverage remains at 78% for the backend. Our goal was to increase this to 85% by the final submission, but we were unable to achieve it due to some functions requiring a more sophisticated testing environment than we had access to.


### User testing was not performed
User testing was another goal we were unable to achieve for our final submission. However, we decided that it was enough for us to manually test the application. We agreed that user testing would not make sense for an application with a small scope such as ours.

For the majority of the decisions made we did a vote either in one of our meetings or in Discord as necessary.
